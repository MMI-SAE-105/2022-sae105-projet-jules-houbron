    <h3 class="a1-np-h1">A simple artist</h3>
    <div class="rectangle-nepal"></div>
    <p class="a1-np-p1">Sundance is a music of the French rapper Nepal, he is a member of the groups "la 75eme session", "les gars laxiste" and "2Fingz".</p>
    <p class="a1-np-p2">His real name Clément Di Fiore, was born on October 12, 1990 in Paris and died on November 9, 2019 at the age of 29. <br>
        This music comes from his latest album entitled: Adios Bahamas.</p>
    <p class="a1-np-p3">The album and all of Nepal's music are freely available on its website: <a href="https://444nuits.com/">https://444nuits.com/</a> since Nepal has always wanted to distribute his music for free. <br>
        The music is produced by Diabi, Jérémie Diabira, who is also the producer of rapper Nekfeu.<br>
        Nepal talks about his life and gives free rein to his thoughts.</p>
        <img class="a1-np-img" src="public/img/nepal-2.webp" alt="Photo du rappeur Nepal">
        <h3 class="a2-np-h1">“Why do you want to do like the others?”</h3>
        <p class="a2-np-p1">In this music, Nepal alludes to Huis-Clos by Jean-Paul Sartre in the chorus when he says: “Since hell is other people, why do you want to do like the others? “.
        Nepal denounces the hypocrisy of people who complain about society but who do the same as others so as not to feel left out.</p>
        <p class="a2-np-p2">The title of the music refers to the Sundance Festival, an American independent film festival. He then plays on the image of independent films which have the cliché of being slow films with little action.
         He then compares his little eventful life with the films presented at the festival: “My life is a Sundance film, sometimes it happens R”.</p>
        <p class="a2-np-p3">Nepal is a dreamer who has trouble keeping his feet on the ground, often in his thoughts as he says in the phrase "Monday to Sunday, stuck in my head".
            According to him, the most important thing to achieve your dreams and to believe in them: “From that time, I learned that the most important thing is to believe in them”<br> </p>

        <p class="a2-np-p4">I really like this music because Nepal is an artist that I really like and I identify with the lyrics and the values conveyed.</p>
