        <p class="a1-esp-p1">Our planet has never been as badly off as it is today on the environmental level, with global warming reaching peak levels and the disappearance of places of life and species because of humans. <br>
            According to an IPCC report, the average temperature is expected to increase by 3.2°C by the end of the century. An increase in temperature which is already having terrible consequences: nearly 3.6 billion people are considered to be very vulnerable to the consequences of global warming, i.e. nearly half of humanity.
            The consequences are diverse: rising waters which will cause the disappearance of certain territories, drought, heat wave, floods...
            Man-made weather conditions also have a terrible impact on animals.
            Emblematic species are now endangered such as the tiger, the polar bear, the blue whale, the orangutan and many others have already disappeared such as the Chinese dolphin in 2006 , the Pyrenean ibex in 2000 and the Caribbean monk seal in 2008.

        <p class="a2-esp-h1">Global warming has caused glaciers to melt, causing sea levels to rise. Some places of life are doomed to disappear, it is 630 million people who are affected by this problem and who will see, by 2100, their place of life exposed to heavy floods. This is a problem that concerns the whole planet, but the Pacific islands are the first affected, about 80% of their surface area is expected to fall below the level of the mother by 2100. <br>
            It is important that everyone acts as soon as possible in order to slow down these phenomena and to preserve our planet and the species that surround us for as long as possible, by drastically reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, it is still possible to save the planet.</p>
